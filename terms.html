            <h3>2. Where These Terms Apply</h3>
            <p>Our services are available to clients anywhere in the world. By engaging our services, you agree to these terms.</p>
            <p>Please note: the laws of England and Wales govern these terms (see Section 10). If you are based outside the UK, you may have additional rights under the laws of your own country that we are not able to limit.</p>

            <h3>3. What You Are Buying</h3>
            <p>Specific deliverables, timelines, and costs will be agreed upon in writing before work commences. This agreement will outline exactly what you are purchasing.</p>

            <h3>4. Client Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Clients agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide accurate information and requirements</li>
                <li>Respond to queries in a timely manner</li>
                <li>Provide necessary access to systems and resources</li>
                <li>Make payments according to agreed terms</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Payment Terms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Payment terms will be specified in individual project agreements</li>
                <li>Invoices are due within 14 days unless otherwise agreed</li>
                <li>We accept payment via bank transfer or Stripe</li>
                <li>Late payments may result in suspension of services</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upon full payment, clients receive ownership of custom-developed code created specifically for their project</li>
                <li>Pre-existing code, frameworks, and third-party libraries remain under their respective licenses</li>
                <li>We may showcase completed work in our portfolio unless confidentiality is agreed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Our Responsibility to You</h3>
            <p>We will do our best to deliver services on time and to a high standard. However:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We cannot guarantee that services will always be available without interruption — for example, during maintenance or due to technical issues outside our control</li>
                <li>We are not liable for losses arising from client-provided content, specifications, or third-party services</li>
                <li>Our liability is limited to the amount paid for the specific service in question</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Nothing in these terms limits our responsibility for fraud, death, or personal injury caused by our negligence. If you are a consumer, you may also have rights under consumer protection laws in your country that we are not able to exclude.</p>

            <h3>8. Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>We will keep confidential any proprietary information shared during the course of our work, except as required by law or with your permission.</p>

            <h3>9. Termination</h3>
            <p>Either party may terminate services with written notice. Clients remain responsible for payment for work completed up to the termination date.</p>

            <h3>10. Which Law Applies</h3>
            <p>These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England & Wales.</p>
            <p>However, if you are a consumer living in another country, you may also have rights under the laws of that country which these terms cannot override.</p>

            <h3>11. Changes to These Terms</h3>
            <p>We may update these terms from time to time. If we make any important changes, we will notify you by email before the changes take effect. Continuing to use our services after that point means you accept the updated terms.</p>

            <h3>12. Questions?</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions about these terms, please contact: <a href="mailto:Nick@NeoBookworm.uk">Nick@NeoBookworm.uk</a></p>
